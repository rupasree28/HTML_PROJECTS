    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>
I am a Computer Science student learning Front-End and Full Stack development, currently building strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and core programming concepts. I focus on hands-on project building rather than just theory, which helps me understand how real websites work—from structure and multimedia to deployment on the internet. My goal is to grow into a skilled software developer by staying consistent, improving step by step, and applying what I learn through practical projects.  I am currently learning HyperText Markup Language>HTML</abbr>
        and preparing myself for a career in the IT industry.
